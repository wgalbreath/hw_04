Welcome to my homework 4 submission!

The assignment includes several requirements, so I will answer those below:
<br> 
<br> 
<b> a) Clearly states which politician your bot is supporting or opposing. </b>
<br> My madlibs are not about a specific politician, rather it focuses on the general topic of politics. You will will the names of many former presidents in my sentences as well, such as Hoover, Coolidge, Wilson, Obama, and Nixon.


<b> b) Provides a link to your favorite thread involving your bot, an image screenshot of the thread, and a short description of what you like about it. (Below each comment is a button labeled permalink that lets you link to a comment.) </b>
<br> 


<b> c) Includes the output of running the bot_counter.py file on your bot to count how many comments you've created. The output of this command must be inside of a markdown code block (i.e. use the triple backticks notation). </b>
<br> 


<b> d) Explains what you believe your score should be. Clearly state which tasks you complete/don't complete. </b>
